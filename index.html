  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>My name is Justin. Ever since elementary school, I have been interested in robots and their programming, and joined my school's robotics club. When I was in 8th grade, I went to an event to show off mine and my groups "code" on MIT app inventor. I am now in 12th grade at Decatur Central High School. I have been coding for around
            3 years now, and plan on studying Computer Science as my major in college. While I'm not 100% sure which
            college I will attend, my top two colleges I would want to attend to are Purdue and IU Bloomington. If you
            are still interested in me, please check out all of the projects I have done and my resume! Thank you for
            reading
