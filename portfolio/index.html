        <h2>About Me: </h2>
         
        <p>My name is Justin. I currently am in 12th grade at Decatur Central High School. I have been coding for around
            3 years now, and plan on studying Computer Science as my major in college. While I'm not 100% sure which
            college I will attend, my top two colleges I would want to attend to are Purdue and IU Bloomington. If you
            are still interested in me please check out all of the projects I have done and my resume! Thank you for
            reading.</p>
